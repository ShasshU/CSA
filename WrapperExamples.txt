1. If you try to unbox a null integer, it will cause a NullPointerException error. This is beccause Integer is a wrapper class, and it expects int, however null is there instead. 
2. We could try something such as an if statement, and check if the int value is null. Something like this could help prevent errors before unboxing.
3. Autoboxing can cause errors when the objects take more memory than the primitive versions, and if theres a lot of scenarious when autoboxing is used, it will increase the memory usage of the program
4. An error will occur because the max and min values are fixed constants built into the program. Attempting to change them will result in an error.
